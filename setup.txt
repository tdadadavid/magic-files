1. Compile the magic file using
    `file -C school.magic`
this will generate a file with extension `.mgc`

2. Now go the C code, where the comment is `Load Database`
    `if (magic_load(magic_cookie, "PUT_THE_RESULT_OF_STEP_1") != 0) {
             printf("Unable to load magic database %s\n", magic_error(magic_cookie));
             magic_close(magic_cookie);
             return 1;
    }`

3. Compile the C code using the command
    `gcc -o detect_school detect_school.c -lmagic`

 4. Run
    `./detect_school <file in the directory or path to a file>`

 Example:
    `./detect_school example`
    You would get a result like this:
    `
     Detected mime type: School
     File is not a School data file
    `

If it is not a School data file
Example:
    `./detect_school notaschoolfile"
    You would get result like this"
    `
    `
